## The 4 Components

### Component 1: Victory Message Calculation ✅
**Files**: `cricket_scorer_screen.dart` (Lines 1007-1034) + `match.dart` (Lines 249-265)

**Second Innings > Target**:
```dart
int wicketsRemaining = 10 - currentScore!.wickets;
result = 'TeamB won by $wicketsRemaining wickets';
```
**Example**: Score 60, Lost 2 wickets → "TeamB won by 8 wickets"

**Second Innings < Target**:
```dart
int runsDifference = currentInnings!.targetRuns - currentScore!.totalRuns;
result = 'TeamA won by $runsDifference runs';
```
**Example**: Target 50, Scored 45 → "TeamA won by 5 runs"

### Victory Message Calculation
```
If score >= target:
    wickets_remaining = 10 - wickets_lost
    message = "TeamB won by {wickets_remaining} wickets"

If score < target:
    runs_deficit = target - actual_score
    message = "TeamA won by {runs_deficit} runs"
```

### Display Logic
```
Live Scorecard:
    IF score >= target:
        Show: _getVictoryMessage() in GREEN
    ELSE:
        Show: "TeamA won by {deficit} runs" in GREEN

Victory Dialog:
    Get message from MatchHistory.result
    Display in large bold text

History Page:
    Show message from MatchHistory.result
